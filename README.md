# Positive Work Environment Task Force


W3C is a global community where participants choose to work together. In that community, we experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings and disagreements happen, and in most cases can be resolved informally.

The CG picks up the work of the former [PWE Task Force](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/).
